All about Git

// list hidden files
ls -a

// create a new text file
touch names.txt

// stage a file to make commit
git add names.txt

// to unstage a file which was earlier staged to commit
git restore --staged names.txt

// to check status
git status

// commit new delta changes with a commit message 
git commit -m"names.txt file is changed"

// to check commit history
git log

// to make a store the current uncommited changes at the backstage
// will have a clean directory to work on without making commits
git stash

// if want to bring back stash changes
git stash pop

// attach remote github repository url with local repository
// origin is the name given to the url - just like phone number saved with name
git remote add origin https://github.com/kbnewbee/all-about-git.git

// to see list of all the urls attached to your local repo
git remote -v

// push changes to github repo
// git push <dest url name> <dest branch name>
git push origin master 

// create a new branch with name feature
git branch feature

// to move to the feature branch
git checkout feature

// to merge changes in feature branch to master branch
// ususally done with pull request
git checkout master 
git merge feature

// if you want to delete recent commits
// reset to the commit just below the commit that you want to remove
git reset <commit>


// fork a project
git remote add upstream <url of the src of forked project>

// this will show both origin and upstream urls
// origin - personal
// upstream - from where you have forked the project 
git remote -v

// open source convention
// make a separate branch after forking a project
git branch feature2
git checkout feature2

// make number of commits in feature2 branch 
// make commit to origin, you cannot commit to upstream

// create a pull request to the main project's main branch
// one branch can only open one pull request

// method 1
// when upstream is ahead by some commits
// fetch all the commits from upstream main branch
git fetch --all --prune

// checkout to main branch in your fork
// sync with the main branch of the original project
git reset --hard upstream/main
// push the changes to your forked repo 

// method 2
// alternate way to fetch and reset - in a single command
git pull upstream main
